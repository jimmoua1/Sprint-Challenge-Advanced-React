- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
        
        Class components help you manage states easier.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

        render() - handles the rendering of your component to the UI.

        componentDidMount() - is called as soon as the component is mounted and ready. This is when the developer is able to initiate API calls, if you need to load data from a remote endpoint.

        componentDidUpdate() - This method is updating the DOM in response to prop or state changes.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

        Custom hooks contain a common stateful logic that can be reused within multiple components. This makes for more reusable code and less lines of code in the long run.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

        It ensures that the code does what we expect. It ensures that the content displays correctly on the DOM for the user. Also with more tests, there will be less errors a developer will have.
